# Interactive Shapes UI
This JavaFX program was created in Winter of 2016 for an assignment in a User Interfaces course. The goal of the project was to create an application that allowed users to add objects (rectangles, ellipses, and text boxes) and manipulate them (increase/decrease their sizes, move them around, etc.). As a user interface course (or HCI course), the main objective was to make the application easy to understand with little instruction.

## Let's Get You Started
