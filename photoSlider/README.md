# Photo Gallery Slider
This JavaFX program was created in Winter of 2016 for an assignment in a User Interfaces course. While this project does not necessarily look aesthetically pleasing, the idea was to create a photo gallery application that was intuitively "easy to use" for the general user. This means that buttons need labels, the buttons' respective locations also mattered, the window pane needed a title for context, etc. This project is one of only a few programming projects that were assigned in this course.

## Let's Get You Started
### Prerequisites
	
	Java JDK 8

Clone the CS3010 repository:
	$ git clone https://github.com/michelleTagarino/CS3010.git

In your terminal, cd into the **photoSlider** directory:

	$ cd photoSlider/

Compile the project:

	$ javac -d . PhotoSlider.java

Run the project:

	$ java photoslider.PhotoSlider


## Slider Instructions

	The whole concept of this project was to create a simple gallery that was so easy to use that it didn't need instructions.
	In the case that the application was *so* bad (let's hope not), here are the instructions:
	1. Look at the image.
	2. Click on the "Next" button to go to the next image.
	3. Click on the "Previous" button to go to the previous image.
